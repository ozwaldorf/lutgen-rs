### Viewing original image

At any point, left-clicking on the image preview will toggle between the edited and original images.

### Editing the palette

Palette colors can be edited by left-clicking on the color, and using the color picker or typing the values.
New colors can be added with the `  +  ` button. Palette colors can be deleted by right-clicking on the color.
